        <h1>Older Is Better!</h1>
        <div class="two-col">
            <p>The aging of wine is potentially able to improve the quality of wine. This distinguishes wine from most other consumable goods. While wine is perishable and capable of deteriorating, complex chemical reactions involving a wine's sugars, acids and phenolic compounds (such as tannins) can alter the aroma, color, mouthfeel and taste of the wine in a way that may be more pleasing to the taster. The ability of a wine to age is influenced by many factors including grape variety, vintage, viticultural practices, wine region and winemaking style. The condition that the wine is kept in after bottling can also influence how well a wine ages and may require significant time and financial investment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="two-col">
            <p>The quality of an aged wine varies significantly bottle-by-bottle, depending on the conditions under which it was stored, and the condition of the bottle and cork, and thus it is said that rather than good old vintages, there are good old bottles. There is a significant mystique around the aging of wine, as its chemistry was not understood for a long time, and old wines are often sold for extraordinary prices. However, the vast majority of wine is not aged, and even wine that is aged is rarely aged for long; it is estimated that 90% of wine is meant to be consumed within a year of production, and 99% of wine within 5 years.</p>

            <div class="two-col">
                <p>  <strong>Cabernet Sauvignon  </strong> - The most planted grape in the world is cabernet sauvignon, and it's a safe (yet sophisticated!) bet to order at just about any meal to please the whole group. While California Cabs can be a bit fruitier, and French Cabs a bit more herbal, a glass is always interesting to drink as you look for notes of cherries and currants, as well as spices.</p>
               
                <p><strong>Merlot </strong> - Merlot is the second-most planted grape, and it's a great entry point for someone trying to get into red wine. The wine is really "easy" to drink, meaning it's fruity and yummy and won't make your mouth pucker up with tannins.</p>
                    
        
            
            </div>
            <div class="two-col">
                <p> <strong>Zinfandel </strong> - For some reason (the marketing campaigns of the 1990s), Zinfandels are often associated with moms. Which is OK! Moms are great, and they have awesome taste: Zinfandel is an interesting wine because the taste can really vary based on where it's grown, though it's usually nice and juicy and high in alcohol content. Imagine juicy, spicy strawberries that get you smashed.</p>
               
                <p> <strong>Syrah/Shiraz </strong> - Called Syrah in France and other European countries, and Shiraz in Australia, South America, and elsewhere, this wine is just plain fun to sip on—it can be peppery, spicy, and bold, with the flavor of rich fruits like blackberry. Break this one out after a long day when you want to sit with a book and a glass of wine and really taste something.</p>
